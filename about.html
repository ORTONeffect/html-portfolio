<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an attorney by trade with a diverse background that has led to my current position as Head of Leasing
  at Ducatus Asset Management. I began my professional career in labour law, demonstrating a strong commitment
  to social justice and fair labour practices. After several years, I transitioned to the property industry, 
  where I have since gained a lot of experience.</p>

<p>My drive for excellence and continuous self-improvement led me to pursue an MBA degree at Stellenbosh 
  University, which I successfully completed in 2020. This achievement reflects my dedication to staying at 
  the forefront of my field and my commitment to personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>As Head of Leasing at Ducatus Asset Management, I oversee the management of several shopping centres, 
  utilizing my extensive knowledge and expertise in property management to ensure their continued success. 
  My ability to manage complex lease agreements, negotiate with tenants, and provide exceptional customer 
  service has earned me the respect of both colleagues and clients alike.</p>

<p>Despite my success in the legal and property industries, I have always had a strong interest in computers 
  and software. In my free time, I have been teaching myself how to code, demonstrating my determination to 
  broaden my skill set and remain at the forefront of technological innovation.</p>

<p>Overall, my career trajectory demonstrates a drive for excellence and a commitment to continuous learning 
  and development. I have a diverse skill and consider myself a highly accomplished and versatile professional.</p>
